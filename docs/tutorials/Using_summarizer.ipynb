       "'The cause of failure for hydroxychloroquine treatment should be investigated by testing the isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains of the non-respondents and analyzing their genome, and by analyzing the host factors that may be associated with the metabolism of hydroxychloroquine. When comparing the effect of hydroxychloroquine treatment as a single drug and the effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromyc in combination, the proportion of patients that had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples was significantly different between the two groups at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion (Table 3)  Cultures. Lessons learnt from chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine use in HIV infection. The peak of the chromatogram at 1.05 min of retention corresponds to hydroxychloroquine metabolite. Equally important, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are generically produced, very inexpensive, and could be made available worldwide. Effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral load. Hydroxychloroquine (17 μM; HCQ) was purchased from Sanofi-Synthelabo. Role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine and Emerging Viruses. Mean hydroxychloroquine serum concentration was 0.46 µg/ml+0.2 (N=20). Hydroxychloroquine differs from chloroquine by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain: the N-ethyl substituent is \\uf062-hydroxylated. Our preliminary results also suggest a synergistic effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The serum concentration of this metabolite is deduced from UV absorption, as for hydroxychloroquine concentration. Recurrence occurred in 11.1% of patients without Hydroxychloroquine treatment. Decrease in the maternal-fetal transmission by hydroxychloroquine 1. Hydroxychloroquine was provided by the National Pharmacy of France on nominative demand. These hits are gemcitabine, gefitinib and vibarabine (FLUAV); gemcitabine, pirlindole dibucaine, fluoxetine and dalbavancin (EV1); gemcitabine, imatinib, ivermectin, lopinavir, lovastatin, ezetimibe, fluoxetine, BCX4430, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (ZIKV); chloroquine and mycophenolic acid (CHIKV); chloroquine, mycophenolic acid, dibucaine and itraconazole (RRV); as well as 5-azacitidine, gemcitabine, trifluridine and vidarabine (HSV-1). The antiretroviral effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine may though become visible in anatomical sanctuaries of those individuals treated with PI-containing antiretroviral regimens. Both chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and auranofin can influence these transitions by exerting a pro-apoptotic effect, the efficacy of which is graphically exemplified by the intensity of the blue color in the corresponding rectangles. In this light, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine should have an anti-reservoir potential. Considering both concentrations provides an estimation of initial serum hydroxychloroquine concentration.
